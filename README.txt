Happy 6th monthsary, love!
Since I can't be with you physically, I made you a digital gift that compose of coding and making a website
and a bonus surprise^^

I hope you will love it and make this day much more special kahit na wala ako physically by your side.

Btw it took me 6 hours to accomplish the website and my bonus surprise hehe
